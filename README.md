![Tableau Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tableau-Dashboard-E97627?style=for-the-badge&logo=tableau&logoColor=white)

## 📌 Description

This **Tableau project** provides a detailed survival analysis of patients with heart failure based on clinical records. The dashboard explores various health indicators—like anaemia, high blood pressure, diabetes, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and more—to uncover patterns in survival rates.

> 🔍 Built to support data-driven decisions in healthcare and cardiology research.

## 📊 Key Insights

- Analyzed data of **299 heart failure patients**, with **96 recorded deaths**.
- Visualized impact of key factors:
  - Anaemia, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Smoking  
  - Ejection Fraction, Serum Creatinine, Age & Time
- Found correlations between **low ejection fraction**, **high serum creatinine**, and **increased mortality**.
- Compared survival rates by **gender**, **age**, and **chronic conditions** using interactive visualizations.
